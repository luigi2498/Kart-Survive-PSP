# Kart Survive PSP.
My first PSP game using QuickGame API with PSPSDK

# About it.
This is a simple game like Flappy Bird (it seems that what you do or basically, the gameplay mechanics are really similar by not saying that they are the same).
Maybe in a future I remake this project but using other tool or environment like Game Maker 8 to improve the game and bring some new features.

# Objective.
Just for knowledge.

# Gameplay screenshoots.
